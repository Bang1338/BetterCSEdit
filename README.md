A better editing for Comic Studio!
</h3>

## Features:
- [X] Change size
- [X] Change rotation degree

## Installation (manual way)
* 1 - Get [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net)
* 2 - Go to Dashboard, press the plus sign
* 3 - [Copy entire script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bang1338/BetterCSEdit/main/BetterCSEdit.js), and paste it
* 4 - Save.

### But then I had very good idea, I used Greasy Fork. See, using Greasy Fork gave me a whole new perspective and I was able to install script without manual step above
* [Install](https://greasyfork.org/vi/scripts/451702-bettercsedit)
* But you will need [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net)
